\section{IBR-DTN}

IBR-DTN is an implementation of the DTN bundle protocol \cite{RFC5050}. It is designed and
implemented with efficiency in mind. Efficient memory usage is critical for
use in embedded systems like wireless routers or smartphones. Another design
goal is the interoperability with DTN2 the reference implementation by the Delay
Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG).

In contrast to the reference implementation it can cope with only 4 MByte of
memory. That way it can be run on wireless routers or similar constrainted
devices.

The modular implementation of IBR-DTN comprises a DTN Core, Convergence Layer
Manager, Bundle Router and Persistent storage.

\section{Other DTN Implementations}

As briefly introduced above there are other implementations of the bundle
protocol available. While ION is, as IBR-DTN, a Linux/Unix implementation
DTNLite is written for TinyOS and DASN for Symbian smartphones.
