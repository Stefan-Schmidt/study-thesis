\chapter{IBR-DTN Implementation}
\section{IBR-DTN}

IBR-DTN is an implementation of the DTN bundle protocol. It is designed and
implemented with efficiency in mind. Efficient memory usage is critical for
use in embedded systems like wireless routers or smartphones. Another design
goal is the interoperability with DTN2 the reference implementation by the Delay
Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG).

The modular implementation comprise a DTN Core, Convergence LAyer Manager,
Bundle Router and Persistent storage.
