Use OpenOCD to do the initial blob install:

The iMotes are shipped with something like TinyOS by default. I wasn't able to
find a bootloader on it so the only way to get it bootstrapped was to use the
JTAG interface.

\begin{verbatim}
Get OpenOCD (v0.4.0) and libftdi (v0.17)
Download the pre-compiled blob from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/imote2-linux/files/
(As root or with fixed US permissions) sudo openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/jtagkey.cfg -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/board/crossbow_tech_imote2.cfg
On another console: telnet localhost 4444
# reset halt
# flash protect 0 0 last off
# flash erase_sector 0 0 258
# flash write_image blob-im2
# flash write_image 2.6.34-rc2-zImage 0x00040000 bin
# flash write_image console-image-imote2.jffs2 0x00240000 bin
\end{verbatim}
