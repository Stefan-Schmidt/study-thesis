\chapter{Base System}
This chapter describes the basic software system we are using on the Imote2
platform. Ranging from the bootloader throught the Linux kernel up to the
userland software stack. Our DTN implementation, IBR-DTN, is excluded here as we
describe them in detail in a separate chapter.

\section{Bootstraping}
The Imote2 comes with TinyOS pre-installed. No bootloader or similar mechanism
is installed to allow reflashing of the device. As a last resort there is JTAG
available on the interface board and we used it together with OpenOCD and an
JTAGKeyTiny to bootstrap our linux system. Blob was used as bootloader to load
the kernel image from flash and give the right parameter to boot into the
userland root file system. Detailed steps can be found in the annex.

\section{Linux Kernel}
A recent Linux kernel (2.6.33) is used on the device. The basic support for the
PXA271 and the Imote2 board was already available in this kernel.
