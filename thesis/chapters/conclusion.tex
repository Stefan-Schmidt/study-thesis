\chapter{Conclusion}

The transmission of small DTN bundles is possible over 802.15.4. Biggest
restrictions are the small payload of only 40 Byte per bundle due to missing
fragmentation in smaller chunks and the slow throughput on the 802.15.4 layer.
With only 575 Bytes per second this is only 0.22 percent of the theoretical
maximum of 250 Kbyte per second. More work on the driver and the ieee802154
respectively the mac802154 stack are needed to avoid the 100ms sleep in
userspace.

On the IBR-DTN side it needs also to be investigated why sometimes the bundle
transmission stalls for several seconds and continues normally afterwards. It
could be the interaction of IBR-DTN with the socket interface to the kernel as well
as some parts in IBR-DTN that needs performance optimizations.
