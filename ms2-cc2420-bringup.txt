Problems:
---------
- Driver hangs with -EBUSY if fifop (gpio 0) is gpio_request()'ed
- IEEE802154 ed function not implemented (not needed?)
- Stack: No security support
- Stack: No AACK support
- Stack: Problems with GTS parsing
- cc2420: Hardware address decoding must be off
[- No suspend and resume support]
[- Cleanup needed]
[- Kernel panic with cdc_subset (Workaround)]

Missing return value handling of xmit().
There should be at least something like this:
RETVAL:
XMIT_SUCCESS
XMIT_SUCCESS_DATPEND
XMIT_FAILURE_CSMACA
XMIT_FAILURE_NOACK

And upper layer should respond with appropriate actions.

Tests (faklb):
--------------
- gnl WORKS
- test - test4 and test7 hangs
- test5 and test6
ioctl: SIOCGIFADDR: Cannot assign requested address

root@imote2:/usr/libexec/lowpan-tools# ./izlisten wpan0
bind: No such device
^C
root@imote2:/usr/libexec/lowpan-tools# ./listen-packet #Works with address set and network up
recv: Network is down
shutdown: Operation not supported

Fixed:
------
- Segfaults in tests
- ioctl oops with missing device
- Len as first byte in TXFIFO
- Add FCS to len byte
- Cut off corr and rssi
