Problems:
---------
- Driver hangs with -EBUSY if fifop (gpio 0) is gpio_request()'ed
- iza assoc hangs
  - Wrong CRC
  - Wrong address
- IEEE802154 ed function not implemented (not needed?)
- Stack: No security support
- Stack: No AACK support
- Stack: Problems with GTS parsing
[- Read out lot codes?]
[- No suspend and resume support]
[- Cleanup needed]
[- Kernel panic with cdc_subset (Workaround)]

1) Try to assoc your wpan-phy with a coordinator running on the same phy.
You will notice that it doesn't work.
(which is probably the root cause of the problem you have reported in one of
your earlier mailing list posts).

2) Missing return value handling of xmit().
There should be at least something like this:
RETVAL:
XMIT_SUCCESS
XMIT_SUCCESS_DATPEND
XMIT_FAILURE_CSMACA
XMIT_FAILURE_NOACK

And upper layer should respond with appropriate actions.


Tests (faklb):
--------------
- gnl WORKS
- test - test4 and test7 hangs
- test5 and test6
ioctl: SIOCGIFADDR: Cannot assign requested address

root@imote2:/usr/libexec/lowpan-tools# ./izlisten wpan0
bind: No such device
^C
root@imote2:/usr/libexec/lowpan-tools# ./listen-packet #Works with address set and network up
recv: Network is down
shutdown: Operation not supported

Fixed:
------
- Segfaults in tests
- ioctl oops with missing device
