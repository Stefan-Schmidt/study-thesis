Time for a 10 x 1 MByte transmission
Time for a 10 MByte transmission

Disconnection:
Can an interrupt be handled? Turning of the receiving/transmitting device and turn
it on again. FXIME: This needs more thinking

Setup:
The measured node is connected over serial to the host with the connector board.
Distance between the nodes is 1m.

Battery performance:
--------------------
Imote2 used with the battery pack (3 x 1,5V AAA). Different loads for the
runtime measurement:
- IDLE:			radio off, limited OS activity
- TRANSMIT-SECOND:	radio on, transmit every second
- TRANSMIT-MINUTE:	radio on, transmit every minute
- TRANSMIT-HOUR:	radio on, transmit every hour
- RECEIVE-SECOND:	radio on, receive every second
- RECEIVE-MINUTE:	radio on, receive every minute
- RECEIVE-HOUR:		radio on, receive every hour

Setup:
The measured node is connected over serial to the host with the connector board
in no power mode. That way no power is supplied via USB from the host to the
board and only the battery power is used. The corresponding node is also
connected to the host but powered over USB. Distance between the nodes is 1m.

No way is provided to ask the hardware for the charge status of the battery so
the only way is to measure until the device turns off due to missing power.
Until this happens a line with the current load and time is added to a log file.
